Dockerfile parser

You can use this script to:
  - Validate your set of Dockerfiles
  - Process your Dockerfiles and output useful informations such as
    what ports are exposed, what are working directories.

How you use this

  from dockerfile import parse_raw_dockerfile
  commands = parse_raw_dockerfile(open('Dockerfile'))
  for command in commands:
    if command.startswith('EXPOSE'):
      print ('EXPOSE', command.rstrip())

What works:

  - Parsing commands and concatenating multiline commands
    into single ones.

What does not work

  - Some nice API that will process parsed commands.
